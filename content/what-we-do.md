**MOBILE APPS:**

- We create native iOS apps using Swift/XCode» or cross plattform (iOS/Android) apps using Googles Flutter» development platform. We recently started exploring the brilliant KaiOS system» for feature phones, making Internet accesssible for the emerging markets. We recently launched the only dating service available for Kaios, named Datinga»
- We started creating iOS apps back in 2008 (as Agile Dimension»). We had presence in the App store from day one and our first app was featured by Apple in one of their iPhone TV commercials "There's an app for that"» (Compass Go). Our participation was approved by Steve Jobs, as all their ads was at that time. Due to the difficulty of keeping old apps profitable, we have closed down many of them and learned a lot over the years on how to create sustainable app ecosystems. Right now we only have these available in App store: Photosane, Fireplace, PowerAid, but more are coming.
